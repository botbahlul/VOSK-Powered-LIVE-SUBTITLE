# VOSK-Powered-LIVE-SUBTITLE
ANDROID APP that can recognize words of LIVE AUDIO/VIDEO STREAMING (powered by VOSK) then TRANSLATE and display it as SUBTITLES

This app has PROS & CONS compared to another Speech Recognition Framework like Free Android Google Speech Recognition, IBM WATSON, and PREMIUM GOOGPLE SPEECH API

PROS:
It's FREE, FULL DUPLEX (CAN DIRECTLY LISTEN TO ANY PLAYERS!) and quietly good enough accuracy

CONS:
It's currently only support 20 languages and NEED BIG STORAGE to store that all LANGUAGE MODELS

NOTES:
This repo doesn't support big files upload, so I can only upload English model

To use another language models please download those SMALL MODELS from VOSK website https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
then extract them into models/src/main/assets folders with FOLDERS NAME in ISO CODES like en-US, ca-ES, de-DE, etc
